David Runge has kindly arranged a tour for Linux Audio Berlin members at
Technische Universit√§t Berlin of their Wave Field Synthesis Lab.

We're all invited tonight at 7pm at the `Electronics Faculty,
Einsteinufer 17c <http://osm.org/go/0MZu3cOw8>`__. Detailed instructions
from David:

    Up some stairs next to the street - leading towards a cafeteria,
    that'll be closed at that hour - there's an entrance to the
    building. Take the elevator or stairs to 3rd floor and find room
    EN325 (left hand from the stairway, right hand from the elevators).
