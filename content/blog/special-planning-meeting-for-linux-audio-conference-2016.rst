At last week's meeting we discussed the current status / possibility of
organizing the Linux Audio Conference 2016 in Berlin. It was decided
that we need to meet again next week to make a decision regarding this,
given the lack of clear answer from the potential Berlin university
venues.


We've created some tickets on
`Github <https://github.com/linux-audio-berlin/LAC16/issues>`__ for the
next meeting. Please take a look and assign it to yourself in case you
can help with any of the tickets. If some wants to be invited to the
organization please let us know :)


The meeting will take place on Wednesday 8th July in c-base starting at
7:30 pm.
