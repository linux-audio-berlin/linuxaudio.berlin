Folks!

First off: Happy new Years! (yeah I know... it's been a while).
Lots has changed in the meantime though:

* We just moved away from |wordpress| to |pelican|, after having many troubles with Sam's MySQL instance
* I had to cancel |lac| and |lac_is_dead_long_live_minilac| |minilac| (nothing one does light-heartedly)
* |c-base| soundlab crew started renovating the soundlab (also) in preparations for above mentioned |minilac|
* Generating lots of meta information for the |minilac| wiki

Although |pelican| is quite comfortable to setup and use, we still would like a more individual theme.
If you can help out, say hello on the mailing list or on github!

Hope to see you all at the next LAUB meeting in March.

Cheerios,
Dave
